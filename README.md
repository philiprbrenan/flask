# Test Flask

Invoke a Python script via the [Python flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com) web server running as a GitHub
action.

You cannot run a production web server like this: but this technique does show
how to test the functionality of a web page by invoking curl to simulate user
actions on the web site to download web pages into local files which can then
be checked to confirm that they contain the expected content.
